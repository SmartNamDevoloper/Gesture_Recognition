Analyzing videos using neural networks, using a 3D convolutional network. 

3D convolutions are a natural extension to the 2D convolutions the filter is moved in three directions (x, y and z). In this case, the input to a 3D conv is a video (which is a sequence of 30 RGB images). If we assume that the shape of each image is 100x100x3, for example, the video becomes a 4-D tensor of shape 100x100x3x30 which can be written as (100x100x30)x3 where 3 is the number of channels. Hence, deriving the analogy from 2-D convolutions where a 2-D kernel/filter (a square filter) is represented as (fxf)xc where f is filter size and c is the number of channels, a 3-D kernel/filter (a 'cubic' filter) is represented as (fxfxf)xc (here c = 3 since the input images have three channels). This cubic filter will now '3D-convolve' on each of the three channels of the (100x100x30) tensor.

Data ingestion pipeline. 
The model needs data in batches. This is done using the concept of generators.  

In this project, the main goals are
Generator:  The generator should be able to take a batch of videos as input without any error. Steps like cropping, resizing and normalization should be performed successfully.

Model: Develop a model that is able to train without any errors which will be judged on the total number of parameters (as the inference(prediction) time should be less) and the accuracy achieved.

Write up: Contains the detailed procedure followed in choosing the final model.
